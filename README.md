# Developmental OAT
- Original Script Author: Clint Jensen


## Description  
This project connects prior work with semantic dementia patients (Rogers, Hodges, Patterson, & Lambon Ralph, 2003) where a set of stimuli (adapted from Snodgrass & Vaderwart, 1980) are used to explore how visual regularities impact real vs fake decisions among paired images (Over-regular Animal Task; OAT). A subset of the stimuli used by Rogers and colleagues were used with children, and the data from that developmental group is explored within the notebooks that comprise this repo.
